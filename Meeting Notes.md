Meeting Notes

21/08/25

------- Code Stuff -------
- make sure self.decoh does what you think it does
- talk to Haining, reconcile results
- compute time dynamics with domain walls present
- check nshell mixedness
- SSE dynamics on the backburner

------- Analytics --------
- Chao-Ming's model with single fermion jump operators, asymptotic behavior connects with upper and lower band, can slow dynamics exist? Steady-state correlation function
